# SUDS: the Single-User Dungeon Server

SUDS began as fun weekend project to set up a text-based adventure game server
and game framework.  The original idea was to make a MUD server and framework,
but I didn't get around to writing the multi-user part of the MUD server :)

## Getting Started

1. Clone the repo
        $ git clone git@github.com:DevinRiley/suds.git
2. Run the server
        $ bin/server
